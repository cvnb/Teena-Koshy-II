\subsection{Biological specimen collection}
2-3ml of venous blood was collected from all the participants. To analyze somatic mutations and the differential expression of \textit{NKX2.5} in the blood and tissue, surgical discards of the diseased heart was collected from of 55 of the cases. The biological specimens from both groups were collected from Sri Ramachandra Hospital and Madras Medical Mission, Chennai after obtaining an informed assent from a parent or guardian. 

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Chromosomal analysis} \label{chranalysis}
Blood specimens were collected from CTHD cases and controls in sterile heparin vacutainers.
Chromosomal analysis was performed based on modified protocol described previously \cite{barch1997agt, moorhead1960chromosome, babu1995human, dracopoli1994current}.
\subsubsection{Culture initiation}
In a pre-labeled sterile 25 cm$^2$ culture flask, 8 ml RPMI medium, 2 ml FBS and 200 µl PHA was aliquoted followed by the addition of 1 ml of the blood sample. The contents were mixed well and incubated at 37°C and 5\% in a carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) incubator. The time of addition of PHA was considered the time of culture initiation and was noted as the zero hour.
\subsubsection{Metaphase arrest and lymphocyte harvesting}
At the 66½ hour after culture initiation 100 µl of ethidium bromide was added and the flask was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. At the 67\textsuperscript{th} hour, 100 µl of colchicine was added incubated at 37°C for a further 60 minutes. Thereafter, the contents were transferred to a clean 15 ml centrifuge tube, labeled appropriately. After centrifuging the contents at 1000rpm for 10 minutes and discarding the supernatant, 10ml of pre-warmed hypotonic solution was added, the contents mixed gently and then incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. Following a second centrifugation at 1000rpm for 10 minutes and discarding the supernatant, approximately 8ml of pre-chilled carnoys fixative was added to the cell suspension while vortexing. Subsequent to 20 minute incubation at room temperature, the contents were once again centrifuged at 1000rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was removed and 10ml of fixative was added. The contents were kept at 4°C for 2 hours or until slide preparation. Before slide preparation, the cell pellet was washed with Carnoys fixative till a white cell pellet and a clear supernatant was obtained. Washing involved centrifugation at 1000rpm for 10 min, discarding the supernatant, addition of 10 ml of fresh fixative and vortexing to mix the contents.
\subsubsection{Slide preparation and Giemsa banding using trypsin and Giemsa (GTG)}
Slides were prepared by dropping an appropriately concentrated suspension of cells from an appropriate height onto clean, pre-chilled slides using a pasteur pipette. It was then placed on a hot plate, maintained at a temperature of 45-50°C, till it dried. The slide was then viewed under a phase contrast microscope and judged for chromosome spreading and adequate drying. Multiple slides were prepared from every sample for GTG-banding as well as FISH analysis. The slides aged overnight at 60°C were stained by GTG banding which involved mild agitation in an 16\%  trypsin solution for  approximately 8-10seconds , rinsing in 1 X PBS, staining in 10\% Giemsa stain for 4-6 minutes and a final rinse with distilled water. 
\subsubsection{Analysis}
For each case a minimum of 25 metaphases were analyzed for numerical and/or structural abnormalities. At least 5 metaphases were captured and karyotyped using the Cytovysion© karyotyping platform. All results were recorded as per the International System of Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) \cite{shaffer2013iscn}. Representative images of a normal female and male are presented in \cref{fig:2_2nmlfemale} and \cref{fig:2_3nmlmale}.

\subsection{Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization analysis}\label{fish}
FISH was performed to rule out the presence of the 22q11 microdeletion in the cases using the cell pellet of lymphocytes arrested in the metaphase
\subsubsection{Slide preparation and pretreatment}
Slides were prepared by dropping an appropriately concentrated suspension from an appropriate height onto clean, pre-chilled slides using a pasteur pipette. It was then placed on a hot plate, maintained at a temperature of 45-50°C, till it dried. The slide was then viewed under a phase contrast microscope and a 22 mm X 22 mm area having the maximum number of well spread metaphase plates was marked using a glass marker. The slides were aged at 90 °C for 1 hour and subsequently pretreated with pepsin to make the chromosomal DNA accessible for hybridization and to protect the morphology of the chromosomes from the denaturation process. The slides were incubated in 2X SSC solution at 37 °C for 1 hour and subsequently in pepsin solution at 37 °C for 13 minutes. Following this, the slides were washed in PBS, formaldehyde fixation solution and again in PBS at about 25 °C for 5 minutes each. Following air drying, the slides were dehydrated for 1 minute each in 70\%, 85\% and 100\% ethanol.
\subsubsection{Probe and target DNA co-denaturation and hybridization}
Approximately 2µl of the dual colour DiGeorge Region Probe-LSI \textit{TUPLE1} SpectrumOrange/LSI \textit{ARSA} SpectrumGreen probe in hybridization buffer was added to the marked area and then covered with coverslip that aided in the spreading of the probe. The sides of the coverslip were sealed using rubber cement and then placed in the HYBrite™ (Abbott Molecular), a hybridization chamber that allows for co-denaturation of the probe and target region and subsequent hybridization. The program parameters for these two processes were 73ºC for 5 minutes and 37ºC for 17 hours respectively.

\subsubsection{Post-hybridization washing}

After 17 hours, the coverslip is removed and the slide is gently agitated in 0.4X SSC/0.3\% IGEPAL wash solution at 70º±1C, for 30 seconds. Following which the slide was gently agitated in the 2X SSC/0.1\% IGEPAL wash solution at 37 °C for 30 seconds. While the slides were still damp 5 µl of the counterstain DAPI II was added, covered with a fresh coverslip and the sides sealed using nail varnish. The slides were stored at 4 °C for at least an hour before analysis.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

Using the Olypmpus BX-60 Fluorescent microscope, both interphase and metaphase chromosomes were analyzed for the presence of the normal number of fluorescent signals. A representative image is presented in \cref{fig:2_4fishcase}.

\subsection{Genomic DNA isolation from blood}\label{dnaisolation}

High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood using the QIAamp® kit as per the manufacturer’s instruction. About 200 μl of blood was added to 20 μl of proteinase K and 200 μl of buffer AL in a 1.5 microcentrifuge tube. .The contents were briefly centrifuged and incubated at 55°C for 10 minutes. Subsequently 200 μl of 100\% ethanol was added and mixed again by pulse-vortexing for 15 seconds. The mixture was carefully applied to the QIAamp mini spin column without wetting the rim and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 minute. The QIAamp Mini spin column was placed in a clean 2 ml collection tube, and the tube containing the filtrate was discarded. Then 500 μl of buffer AW1 and AW2 was added sequentially and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 minute. Finally, the DNA was eluted in 200 μl of AE buffer into a collection tube. The DNA eluted was stored at -50 °C until use in experiments
 
\subsection{Genomic DNA isolation from tissue} \label{tissuedna}

The cardiac tissue was mechanically homogenized using a mortar and pestle and transferred to a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. After adding 100 μl of ATL buffer and 20 μl of proteinase K it was mixed by vortexing, and incubated at 56°C. At the end of 2 hours, 200 µl buffer AL was added to the sample, mixed by pulse-vortexing for 15 s, and incubated at 70°C for 10 min. Subsequently 200 μl of 100\% ethanol was added and mixed again by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. Then the remaining steps were similar to that of DNA isolation from the blood tissue; thus the DNA was eluted in 200 μl of AE buffer and stored at -50 °C until use in experiments. 

\subsection{Qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA} \label{dnaanalysis}

\subsubsection{Agarose gel electrophoresis}

The quality of the isolated DNA was checked in a 0.8\% agarose gel. About 0.8 g of agarose was dissolved in 100ml of 1X TAE buffer by boiling. The solution was allowed to become lukewarm followed by which ethidium bromide was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The gel was then poured on a gel-casting tray and allowed to solidify and placed in an electrophoresis tank with 1X TAE buffer. The DNA samples were mixed with 6X bromophenol blue dye, loaded into the wells and electrophoresed at 2 volts/cm. The gels visualized in a gel documentation system (Bio Rad) and the quality of DNA was interpreted based on the band intensity as observed in \cref{fig:2_5DNAqlty}A.

\subsubsection{Analysis using the nanodrop} 

The quantity of the DNA specimens were assessed using the nanodrop based on the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm. About 2 µl of the DNA was added to the lower pedestal of the nanodrop and the assessment of the purity of DNA was made. A ratio of ~1.8 was generally accepted as a good quality DNA (\cref{fig:2_5DNAqlty}B).

\subsection{Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)}

Amplification of the gene of interest rs1801133, rs1801131, rs1051266, rs1805087, rs1801394  rs1532268, \textit{TBX1} and \textit{NKX2.5} was performed using specific primers under appropriate cycling conditions of denaturation, annealing and extension in a Thermal cycler (Master Cycler gradient- Eppendorf).

The PCR was performed in 20µl reactions with a master mix comprising of all the components listed in \cref{tab:2.2pcrmm}, except the template, was prepared and aliquoted into separate tubes. The template DNA was then added; the tubes were placed in the thermal cycler and subjected to the standardized PCR conditions. The PCR conditions were standardized for each gene by gradient PCR. While the annealing temperature and time differed for the each of the genes in this study, the remaining PCR conditions were constant and are given in \cref{fig:2_6pcrconditions}. The presence of amplicons was confirmed by 2\% agarose gel electrophoresis. A 100 bp DNA molecular weight marker was used confirm the amplicon size. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4V/cm and the gel was visualized in the gel documentation system. The representative gel images are presented in the respective chapters.

\subsection{DNA sequencing} \label{sequencing}

The amplified product of the respective genes was sequenced in two steps; a sequencing PCR followed by post PCR processing and sequencing.  Bi-directional sequencing PCR was performed with the amplicon as the template, with the respective forward or reverse primers (\cref{tab:2.3cycseqmm}) and then dispensed equally into microAmp 96well plate. The amplicons were then added to the wells and subjected to sequencing PCR reaction which is outlined in \cref{fig:2_7cycseqconditions}.

\end{figure}

For the post processing purification 20 μl of EDTA, followed by 30 μl of 100\% ethanol was added to each well containing products of the cycle sequencing. The plate was incubated at 370C for 10 minutes, and spun at 3600rpm for 30 minutes. A pop spin was given at 200rpm for 5 seconds, following which, 25 μl of 70\% ethanol was added to the wells. The plate was then spun at 3600 rpm for 5 minutes, followed by a second pop spin. After air- drying, 10 μl of Hi-Di formamide was added and the plate was linked for sequencing to the Genetic Analyzer 3730 (Applied Biosystem, UK).

\subsection{RNA isolation and cDNA conversion from tissue and blood} 
About 10 mg of cardiac tissue was ground in 1 ml of trizol reagent using a sterile mortar and pestle. The resulting suspension was transferred to a 2 ml microfuge tube and the mixture was incubated for 10 minutes. Whereas, in blood samples, the white blood cells (WBC) were isolated in Ficoll-histopaque density gradient centrifugation medium  and  re-suspended in trizol reagent. For both the tissue and WBC suspended in the trizol, 200 μl of chloroform was added and incubated for 10 minutes. The tubes were then spun at 10,000rpm for 10 minutes. The top phase was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 500 μl of 70\% ethanol was added to it. The mixture was spun down and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was allowed to dry and was suspended in 20μl of sterile water. 

All the RNA samples were adjusted to the equal concentration before proceeding to cDNA synthesis. A 10µl reaction was set up (composition as given in \cref{tab:2.4cdnamm}) using 10µl of 2 X RT master mixes was added and 10µl of total RNA in a clean sterile PCR tube. The tube was placed inside master cycler PCR and amplified using the program as given below in \cref{tab:2.5cdnaprog}. The cDNA was then stored at -20°C until further processing in a clean sterile PCR tube.

\subsection{RT-PCR}
RT-PCR was performed in the thermocycler (9700 HT RT-PCR, Applied Biosystem, UK) using SYBR green chemistry. A master mix comprising of all components except the template was prepared as given in \cref{tab:2.6rtmm} and aliquoted into separate tubes.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The template was then added and the tubes were placed in the thermal cycler and subjected to PCR conditions with  initial temperature of 55°C for 10 minutes and a hold temperature of 95°C for SYBR green activation followed by denaturation and annealing temperatures of 55C for 1 min. Negative controls without cDNA were also performed. A melting curve analysis was made after each run to ensure a single amplified product for every reaction. The amount of target gene, normalized to an endogenous control β-actin was determined by the delta C$_t$ method.
