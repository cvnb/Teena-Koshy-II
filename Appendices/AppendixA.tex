\textit{Abstract of IJMR\textunderscore 622\textunderscore 14}

\textit{Background}: Subtelomeres are prone to deleterious rearrangements owing to their
proximity to unique sequences on one end and telomeric repetitive sequences,
which increase their tendency to recombine, on the other. These subtelomeric
rearrangements resulting in segmental aneusomy are reported to contribute to the
aetiology of idiopathic intellectual disability/developmental delay (ID/DD) and
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a sensitive and rapid method to
detect such rearrangements.

\textit{Methods}: One hundred and twenty seven subjects with idiopathic ID/DD were tested for subtelomeric rearrangements using karyotyping and FISH. Blood samples were cultured, harvested, fixed and GTG banded using standard protocols. FISH was performed using the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modifications.
Results: Rearrangements involving the subtelomeres were observed in 7.8\% of the
tested sample population. Detection of rearrangements visible at the resolution
of the karyotype constituted 2.3\%, while those rearrangements detected only
with FISH constituted 5.5\%. Five deletions and five unbalanced translocations
were detected. Analysis of parental samples wherever possible was informative
regarding the inheritance of the rearrangement.

\textit{Discussion}: Our study was retrospective, and in order to reduce selection bias,
we did not use a stringent inclusion criteria. The observed frequency is within
the reported range of 0–35\% and is representative of the Indian population,
from which data is very limited. All abnormal genotypes were clinically
correlated. Further analysis with array technologies present a future prospect.
Our results emphasize the need to test individuals with ID/DD for subtelomeric
rearrangements using sensitive and cost-effective methods such as FISH.
